1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository for projects that have multiple collaborators, making it easier for others to obtain clones of the project and contribute to the project. Also, a remote repository serves as a backup in case something happens to your local repository, or you want or need to switch computers for some reason.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having Git auto-update with your remote might be okay if you knew you were the only one working on that particular project, but oftentimes there are multiple people working on the same project and contributing their own changes. It's possible someone may have altered the code in such a way as to conflict with the code you're currently trying to implement. With manual pulls it is easier to catch such problems beforehand.

1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It turns your existing folder into a git repository and creates a special .git file which is hidden. This hidden .git file is used to record the history of changes made to the files in the repository and the repository itself. This is needed to be able to perform git commands and version control on a folder.
